# Minigames Hub

This is a minigames hub made with python and the customtkinter module, featuring popular games such as TicTacToe, Hangman, Snake and Gamele. We are hoping to improve this project massively over time and soon introducing a completely new game, Gamele, guess the video game character, styled similarly to games such as Wordle.
